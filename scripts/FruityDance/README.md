# Fruity Dance (Psych/V-Slice)
### Recreation of the Fruity Dance plugin from FL Studio, wow!!!

Works very similarly to Fruity Dance:
- Drag around the dancer using your ***mouse...***
- Alternate between different dances using the ***spacebar...***
- Toggle Freestyle Mode using the ***backtick key...***

Also somewhat supports **custom sprite sheets** in a similar way to Fruity Dance via these requirements:
- Each frame has a resolution of ***220 by 256...***
- Total of ***8 frames*** per animation...
- Last animation is ***always*** a 'held by mouse' animation...

The location of the dancer along with it's current animation is also saved, so they'll persist through different songs and game restarts!
