shrimpleHUD is a HUD script for Psych Engine with a slight focus on simplicity.
Supports both Upscroll and Downscroll!
This HUD script properly supports versions 0.7.2+ and 0.6.3. I haven't tested any other version though, so don't be surprised if it doesn't display correctly on any other version.

There are currently 3 different HUD styles packaged in the script:
Vanilla-like: shrimpleHUD's take on the classic HUD seen in the base game!
Shrimple: shrimpleHUD's own custom HUD style!
sKade: A simple recreation of Kade Engine's UI (with a few tweaks), based on KE 1.5.4!

Upon first install, the script will be set on the Vanilla-like style.
Pressing 9 during a song will cycle through the available styles and the currently selected style will be saved and applied on the next song you play, even persisting through game restarts!

There may be more HUD styles added to the script later on, but don't count on it.

If you wish to use this for your mod, video, anything really...
